* The first challenge, I think it's the first one for everyone who is starting the journey through Kaggle and data analysis is the titanic challenge. The focus of this competition is to introduce students to the world of data analysis. It is a simple competition, whose data for training and testing are available on the Kaggle website. The idea of the challenge is from the training data set, to create a model capable of predicting who were the survivors of the Titanic sinking that occurred between the 14th and 15th of April in the year 1912, in the North Atlantic.<br/>

* The second challenge is House Prices, whose objective is to determine the price of houses using regression techniques. It is an excellent introduction to the study of statistical analysis. <br/>
