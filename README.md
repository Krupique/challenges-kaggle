A basic description of datasets and competitions:<br/>

* **Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster**<br/>
  The first challenge, I think it's the first one for everyone who is starting the journey through Kaggle and data analysis is the titanic challenge. The focus of this competition is to introduce students to the world of data analysis. It is a simple competition, whose data for training and testing are available on the Kaggle website. The idea of the challenge is from the training data set, to create a model capable of predicting who were the survivors of the Titanic sinking that occurred between the 14th and 15th of April in the year 1912, in the North Atlantic.<br/>

* **House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques**<br/>
  The second challenge is House Prices, whose objective is to determine the price of houses using regression techniques. It is an excellent introduction to the study of statistical analysis and regression. <br/>

* **London Dataset**<br/>
  The London dataset for Machine Learning is a dataset obtained from Kaggle and the main objective behind this dataset is to carry out studies of Machine Learning algorithms. The dataset itself does not have information about the columns or a context of the data, however, the data are organized in such a way that it facilitates the application of the most varied types of algorithms, such as: Naive Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.
  
* **Wine dataset for Clustering** <br/>
  The Wine dataset consists of a database containing several attributes about wines. The objective is to use clustering and clustering algorithms to classify these data in some way.<br/>

 * **International football results from 1872 to 2022**<br/>
 This project aimed to apply an exploratory analysis of data from official and unofficial matches of the national teams. The project was basically made to test my knowledge using the main Python data analysis libraries.<br/>

 * **Brazilian football championship**<br/>
 The dataset was obtained from the Football-Data website. Football-Data is a free football betting portal that provides historical results and odds to help football betting enthusiasts analyze many years of data quickly and efficiently.<br/>

 * **SMS Spam Collection**<br/>
  The 'SMS Spam Collection' dataset is a set of SMS messages with tags that have been collected for SMS Spam search. It contains an English SMS message set of 5,574 messages, marked according to ham (legitimate) or spam.<br/>

  * **Amazon Musical Instruments Reviews**<br/>
   The 'Amazon Musical Instruments Reviews' dataset is a set of records about user ratings on certain products purchased through the Amazon website. The dataset has 10261 evaluation records, but the data is very unbalanced, which is common in this type of problem and this will cause us some problems, let's try to get around them.<br/>

 * **Classical Music MIDI**<br/>
 The dataset consists of classical piano midi file compositions containing 19 famous composers such as: Beethoven, Bach, Chopin, Mozart and others. The dataset was scrapped from the website: http://www.piano-midi.de. However, as a piano lover, I gradually added files taken from other sites and incremented the dataset on my own. So if you browse the project's data/ directory you will find a more complete dataset.<br/>

 * **Store Item Demand Forecasting Challenge**<br/>
  This competition is provided as a way to explore different time series techniques on a relatively simple and clean dataset. The analyst is given 5 years of store item sales data and is asked to forecast 3 months of sales for 50 different items across 10 different stores.<br/>

  * **Estimating Illicit Accounts** <br/>
  In this notebook, a case of classification of illicit accounts will be solved. Customer accounts have the following classifications: A, B, C, D and F. F being F for accounts considered Fraud.
The objective of this project is to perform a descriptive analysis of the data and the creation of a Machine Learning model capable of classifying accounts as 0 for legal (normal) accounts and 1 for illegal accounts (Fraud).<br/>

  * **What is the Effect of Marijuana Legalization on Crime Rates Over Time?**<br/>
  In 2016, California voters in the US passed Proposition 64, which legalized the recreational use of marijuana in the state.
We will perform data analysis based on time series and geospatial analyses, in addition to other more general exploratory techniques, to examine whether these predictions have come true in Los Angeles since legalization took effect.<br/>

* **Marketing Analytics**<br/>
 Complete Marketing Analytics project with advanced techniques of Descriptive Analysis, Statistical Analysis, Clustering, Regression and Business Analytics in order to explain and make forecasts for the areas of Marketing, Sales and Management of the company's business.<br/>

* **Blood Pressure Predictor using Amazon SageMaker**<br/>
The main objective is the deployment of this project in a cloud environment. The environment chosen was the Amazon AWS cloud environment called SageMaker. Amazon SageMaker is a service that makes it easy to build, train, and execute machine learning (ML) models quickly and reliably. It is fully managed by AWS, which removes the heavy lifting from each step, so the user can develop high quality ML models.<br/>
